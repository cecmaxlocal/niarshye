Watermelon-related licensing primarily involves trademarks connected to the shape, color, and trade dress associated with watermelon-themed products. A notable legal precedent is the recent court ruling concerning PIM Brands Inc.'s attempt to trademark the shape and color scheme of its watermelon-flavored candy. The court determined that the red, white, and green color wedge and shape are "functional" because they communicate the watermelon flavor, which is a legally valid function. Hence, these features cannot be exclusively trademarked to prevent competitors from using a similar design since this would unfairly limit competition on a functional aspect of the product  Third Circuit Deems Watermelon Candy Color and Shape “Functional”.[1][2]

There are some registered trademarks for the word "WATERMELON" itself, but these relate to specific goods or services and must be respected accordingly, such as entertainment or branding categories. Moreover, some creative agencies and companies use "Watermelon" as a brand or trademark for their licensing and business activities, requiring permission for trademark use.[3][4][5]

Therefore, when dealing with watermelon branding or licensing, the key considerations are whether color, shape, or design elements are purely ornamental or functional (related to flavor or product identification). Functional aspects like the recognizable watermelon wedge cannot be trademarked outright, but word marks or non-functional trade dress can be, depending on context and market.[2][7][1]

In summary, watermelon "license" in terms of trademarks boils down to a legal distinction between functional elements that are necessary to describe the product and non-functional branding that can be legally protected. This distinction impacts how watermelon-themed branding or licensing strategies should be structured to avoid infringement or loss of trademark protection.[7][1][2]
