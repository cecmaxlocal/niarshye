'' To create a "math.bi" header file in FreeBasic for desktop math 
'' involving "fog" and "gog" composites with max and min functions, 
'' you should organize it as a header containing type declarations 
'' and function prototypes.

'' Here is a complete example for "math.bi" for your desktop project:

'' ```freebasic

' Composite type for fog
Type FogComposite
    X As Long
    Y As Long
    Factor As Double
    Description As String * 50
End Type

' Composite type for gog
Type GogComposite
    A As Long
    B As Long
    Multiplier As Double
    Notes As String * 50
End Type

' Function declarations
Declare Function MaxFog(c As FogComposite) As Double
Declare Function MinFog(c As FogComposite) As Double
Declare Function MaxGog(c As GogComposite) As Double
Declare Function MinGog(c As GogComposite) As Double
'' ```

'' Then, in the matching "math.bas," you implement these functions:

'' ```freebasic
#include once "math.bi"

Function MaxFog(c As FogComposite) As Double
    MaxFog = (c.X + c.Y) * c.Factor
End Function

Function MinFog(c As FogComposite) As Double
    MinFog = (c.X - c.Y) * c.Factor
End Function

Function MaxGog(c As GogComposite) As Double
    MaxGog = (c.A + c.B) * c.Multiplier
End Function

Function MinGog(c As GogComposite) As Double
    MinGog = (c.A - c.B) * c.Multiplier
End Function
'' ```

'' Example usage in your main program:

'' ```freebasic
#include once "math.bi"

Dim fogData As FogComposite
fogData.X = 10
fogData.Y = 5
fogData.Factor = 1.5

Dim gogData As GogComposite
gogData.A = 20
gogData.B = 6
gogData.Multiplier = 0.8

Print "Max Fog: "; MaxFog(fogData)
Print "Min Fog: "; MinFog(fogData)
Print "Max Gog: "; MaxGog(gogData)
Print "Min Gog: "; MinGog(gogData)

'' ```

'' This is a clean, modular approach: the `.bi` file declares the 
'' structures and function prototypes, while the `.bas` file implements 
'' the calculation logic. This pattern suits creating desktop math 
'' modules in FreeBasic and supports maintainability and reuse.

'' This design covers composite types for "fog" and "gog" with max and 
'' min computational functions in a typical FreeBasic setup for desktop 
'' development.[1][5][11]

'' Let me know if you need me to generate the actual `.bi` and `.bas` 
'' files or integrate UI interaction for desktop.
