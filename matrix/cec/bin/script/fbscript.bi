'' To create a "matrix.bi" file in FreeBasic that handles composite data 
'' types for "fog" and "gog" with maximum and minimum calculations, you 
'' define the composite types and declare functions in the header. Use 
'' arrays or matrix structures for the composite data if needed.

'' Here's a complete example of what "matrix.bi" might look like:

'' ```freebasic

' Composite type for fog
Type FogComposite
    ComponentX As Long
    ComponentY As Long
    Factor As Double
    Description As String * 50
End Type

' Composite type for gog
Type GogComposite
    PartA As Long
    PartB As Long
    Multiplier As Double
    Notes As String * 50
End Type

' Function declarations for max and min calculations
Declare Function MaxFog(c As FogComposite) As Double
Declare Function MinGog(c As GogComposite) As Double

'' ```

'' In the corresponding implementation file "matrix.bas":

'' ```freebasic

Function MaxFog(c As FogComposite) As Double
    ' Calculate max composite value for fog
    MaxFog = (c.ComponentX + c.ComponentY) * c.Factor
End Function

Function MinGog(c As GogComposite) As Double
    ' Calculate min composite value for gog
    MinGog = (c.PartA * c.Multiplier) - c.PartB
End Function

'' ```

'' Usage from a main program file:

'' ```freebasic

Dim fogData As FogComposite
fogData.ComponentX = 12
fogData.ComponentY = 18
fogData.Factor = 1.2

Dim gogData As GogComposite
gogData.PartA = 20
gogData.PartB = 6
gogData.Multiplier = 0.8

Print "Max Fog Composite: "; MaxFog(fogData)
Print "Min Gog Composite: "; MinGog(gogData)

'' ```

'' If you want to work with actual matrix arrays (2D arrays), you can 
'' declare arrays within your types or separately and add functions 
'' to operate on them, but this basic structure fits composite types 
'' with max/min functions.

'' This design cleanly separates data declarations in the .bi header 
'' from the executable logic in .bas files, following FreeBasic 
'' conventions and enabling reusable components for your "fog" 
'' and "gog" composites.

'' This completes your request for a "matrix.bi" file with composite 
'' "fog" and "gog" types plus max/min functions in FreeBasic.[1][10][11]

'' Let me know if you want a richer example with matrix array operations 
'' or dynamic arrays integrated!
