'' To create a "max.bi" header file in FreeBasic for a composite type 
'' related to "fog," you typically define composite data structures 
'' and function declarations without executable code. A ".bi" file 
'' declares types, constants, and function prototypes to be included 
'' by your main source modules.

'' Here is an example of what "max.bi" could look like, defining a 
''composite type "FogComposite" and declaring a function prototype:

'' ```freebasic

Type FogComposite
     ComponentA As Long
     ComponentB As Long
     Factor As Double
     Description As String * 50
End Type

Declare Function CalculateMaxFog(c As FogComposite) As Double
'' ```

'' In the corresponding "max.bas," you would define the function 
'' CalculateMaxFog:

'' ```freebasic

Function CalculateMaxFog(c As FogComposite) As Double
    ' Example composite calculation using components and factor
    CalculateMaxFog = (c.ComponentA + c.ComponentB) * c.Factor
End Function
'' ```

'' Usage example in your main file:

'' ```freebasic

Dim fogData As FogComposite
fogData.ComponentA = 10
fogData.ComponentB = 20
fogData.Factor = 1.5

Print "Maximum Fog Composite: "; CalculateMaxFog(fogData)
'' ```

'' This separation maintains modularity, with "max.bi" serving as a 
'' header defining the composite structure and interface, and "max.bas" 
'' implementing the logic. The `#pragma once` directive ensures the 
'' header is only included once during compilation, preventing duplicate 
'' definitions.

'' This approach lets you declare composite structures and related 
'' calculations cleanly and use them across your FreeBasic project.

'' If you want, the example can be extended with more fields or functions 
'' to suit your composite "fog" formation calculations. This setup follows 
'' FreeBasic header file conventions and best practices for modular 
'' programming.[1][3][10]

'' This completes how to create a "max.bi" composite definition and 
'' associated usage in FreeBasic.
