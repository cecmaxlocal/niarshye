'' To create a "min.bi" file in FreeBasic for a composite type related 
'' to "gof" (like a data structure for composite formation), similar to 
'' previous patterns, you define the composite data type and declare 
'' any related functions in the header file. 

'' Example content for "min.bi":

'' ```freebasic

Type GofComposite
    Part1 As Long
    Part2 As Long
    Ratio As Double
    Notes As String * 50
End Type

Declare Function CalculateMinGof(c As GofComposite) As Double

'' ```

'' This file should only contain the data structure and a function 
'' prototype, no function implementation.

'' In the corresponding .bas file (e.g., "min.bas"), define the function 
'' logic:

'' ```freebasic

Function CalculateMinGof(c As GofComposite) As Double
    ' Simple example computation using fields
    CalculateMinGof = (c.Part1 * c.Ratio) - c.Part2
End Function

'' ```

'' Usage example from your main program:

'' ```freebasic

Dim comp As GofComposite
comp.Part1 = 15
comp.Part2 = 5
comp.Ratio = 0.75

Print "Minimum Gof Composite: "; CalculateMinGof(comp)

'' ```

'' This approach cleanly separates declarations from implementations 
'' and suits modular FreeBasic programming. The `.bi` ensures your 
'' composite type and function declarations are available wherever 
'' needed without redundant code duplication. The implementation 
'' computes a defined minimum composite value based on your 
'' composite structure fields.

'' If you want a more complex composition calculation or additional 
'' methods in the `.bi` declaration, that can be added similarly.

'' This follows best practices in FreeBasic header files and modular 
'' design for composite types like a "gof" composite.[1][2][3]

'' This completes your request to create a "min.bi" for a "gof" 
'' composite in FreeBasic.
