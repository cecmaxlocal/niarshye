'' To create a "gof.bi" file in FreeBasic for composite data (likely a 
'' composite data type), here are the key guidelines and an example:

'' ### What is a .bi file in FreeBasic?
'' - A ".bi" file is a header file used for declarations only (e.g. type 
'' declarations, constants, function prototypes).
'' - The executable or function definitions go into corresponding 
'' ".bas" files.
'' - The .bi file is included in the main source code or modules using 
'' the `#include` preprocessor directive.
'' - Typically, no executable code goes in .bi files, only declarations 
'' used by other source files.[1][2]

'' ### How to create a composite data structure in gof.bi
'' - Use the `Type ... End Type` construct to define composite types 
'' in FreeBasic.
'' - Declare related variables and constants here if needed.
'' - Then include this header file in your main .bas file to use these types.

'' ### Example: gof.bi for a composite type

'' ```freebasic
' gof.bi - composite type header for FreeBasic

Type CompositeData
     Component1 As Long
     Component2 As Long
     CompositionFactor As Double
     Description As String * 50
End Type

Declare Function CalculateComposite(c As CompositeData) As Double


'' ### Corresponding gof.bas (for function definition)


Function CalculateComposite(c As CompositeData) As Double
    ' Example calculation using components
    CalculateComposite = (c.Component1 + c.Component2) * c.CompositionFactor
End Function

'' ### Usage in main.bas

'' ```freebasic

Dim c As CompositeData
c.Component1 = 10
c.Component2 = 20
c.CompositionFactor = 1.5

Print "Composite Value: "; CalculateComposite(c)

'' ```

'' This outlines the proper module split with the .bi file declaring the 
'' composite structure and function prototype, and the .bas files 
'' containing the actual function code and usage.

'' Would you like me to generate a complete minimal example set for your 
'' "gof.bi" file and matching .bas files based on your specific composite 
'' formation requirements?
