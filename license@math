Licenses related to math software and tools vary widely depending on the context of use—academic, commercial, personal, or teaching—and the specific software involved. For example, MATLAB offers several types of licenses including commercial, startup, academic teaching, student, and personal use licenses. These vary by rights granted (such as duration—annual or perpetual), target user (individual, institution, or commercial entity), and included features or add-on products.[1]

There are also specialized licenses for math teaching professionals, which involve educational certification requirements distinct from software licensing. These teaching licenses typically require a bachelor's degree, passing content assessments, completing certification programs with residency, and licensing applications to become certified math teachers.[2]

Other math software like Wolfram Mathematica provides commercial and non-profit licenses, with variations for government, education, home, and student use, often including service plans and upgrades.[4]

Open-source math libraries, such as Math.NET Numerics, often permit free usage under permissive licenses, typically requiring attribution and allowing modification and redistribution with few restrictions. Some math-related educational content and tools have licenses that restrict commercial use or require crediting the original source.[9][10]

In summary, the type of math-related license you need depends on whether you are licensing software for use, distributing math software or libraries, or pursuing professional math teaching credentials. Understanding the particular license terms and intended use—commercial, educational, personal, or open-source—is key to compliance and choosing the right license model.[10][1][2][4][9]
